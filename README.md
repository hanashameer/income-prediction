# Predicting Income Level using ML classifiers
This project focuses on predicƟng whether an individual's
annual income exceeds $50,000 using classificaƟon-based
machine learning models. Leveraging the Adult Census
Income dataset, we aim to idenƟfy significant demographic
and employment-related features that influence income
levels. The project progresses through three stages: data
understanding and preprocessing, model training, and model
evaluaƟon.
During the iniƟal phase, comprehensive exploratory data
analysis (EDA) was performed to understand data paƩerns,
handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale
features appropriately. MulƟple classificaƟon algorithms were
then trained and tested, including LogisƟc Regression, kNearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and MulƟ-layer Perceptron
(MLP), with addiƟonal exploraƟon into Gradient BoosƟng and
XGBoost models.
Each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall,
F1-score, and confusion matrix. Hyperparameter tuning was
also conducted for selected models to opƟmize performance.
The findings of this project can support informed decisionmaking in financial, social, and governmental domains.
