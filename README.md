# Predicting Income Level using ML classifiers
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's
annual income exceeds $50,000 using classification-based
machine learning models. Leveraging the Adult Census
Income dataset, we aim to identify significant demographic
and employment-related features that influence income
levels. The project progresses through three stages: data
understanding and preprocessing, model training, and model
evaluation.
During the initial phase, comprehensive exploratory data
analysis (EDA) was performed to understand data patterns,
handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale
features appropriately. Multiple classification algorithms were
then trained and tested, including Logistic Regression, kNearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multi-layer Perceptron
(MLP), with additional exploration into Gradient Boosting and
XGBoost models.
Each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall,
F1-score, and confusion matrix. Hyperparameter tuning was
also conducted for selected models to optimize performance.
The findings of this project can support informed decisionmaking in financial, social, and governmental domains.
